    "So we get 20% right. This is not bad for a baseline. Note that random guessing would give us only 7%. Of course we need to improve. You might have notices that we’re dealing with a time series here. And we’re not making use of that fact right now as we look at each training example only individually. But this is ok for now. More advanced courses like “Advanced Machine Learning and Signal Processing” (https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-machine-learning-signal-processing/) will teach you how to improve accuracy to the nearly 100% by using algorithms like Fourier transformation or wavelet transformation. But let’s skip this for now. In the following cell, please use the RandomForest classifier (you might need to play with the “numTrees” parameter) in the code cell below. You should get an accuracy of around 44%. More on RandomForest can be found here:\n",
