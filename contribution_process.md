# Contributing

Welcome to CLAIMED! 

Thanks a lot for considering contributing to this project.

We welcome (and accept) any kind of contribution. Ideally, before contributing to one
of our repositories, please create an issue on the repository's issue tracker.

If you feel confident, you can also directly submit a pull request to the repositories.
We try to review (and answer to) new issues and PRs on a daily basis.

We may ask you to improve your PR if necessary. Once ready, it will be merged by one of the
core committers.

Every major functionality addition or change must be covered by a test added to the repositories automated test suite. Please see [example](https://github.com/claimed-framework/component-library/blob/master/claimed/run_tests.py).
